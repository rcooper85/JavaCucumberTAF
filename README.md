# Java Cucumber Test Automation Framework (TAF)
 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rcooper85/JavaCucumberTAF.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rcooper85/JavaCucumberTAF) 

A Java Cucumber framework that uses Selenium to interact with the UI and JUnit to carry out assertions.

This framework uses the Page Object Model design pattern and uses dependency injection (pico-container) so that state can be shared between cucumber steps.   

The AUT for this framework is https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/
